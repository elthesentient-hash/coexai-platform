# First Principles Thinking

Reason from fundamental truths rather than analogy or convention.

## What is First Principles?

Instead of:
- Copying what others do (analogy)
- Following tradition (convention)
- Accepting "that's how it's done"

Do:
- Break to fundamental truths
- Question every assumption
- Build up from basics
- Create original solutions

## The Method

### Step 1: Identify Problem
Clearly define what you're trying to solve.

### Step 2: List Assumptions
Write down everything you assume:
- "This is expensive"
- "This takes X time"
- "This requires Y resource"
- "This is done by Z method"

### Step 3: Break to Fundamentals
For each assumption, ask:
- "Is this fundamentally true?"
- "What are the physics/economics/logic?"
- "What is actually required?"

### Step 4: Build Up
From fundamentals, build solution:
- What's actually needed?
- What's the optimal approach?
- What hasn't been tried?

## Techniques

### Socratic Questioning
- "Why?" (ask 5 times)
- "How do we know this is true?"
- "What if the opposite is true?"
- "What are we assuming?"

### Feynman Technique
1. Choose concept to learn
2. Teach it to a child (simple language)
3. Identify gaps in understanding
4. Review and simplify
5. Repeat until crystal clear

### Inversion
- Think backwards from failure
- "What would guarantee this fails?"
- Avoid those things
- Clear path to success

## Applications

### For Innovation:
- Don't improve existing solution
- Rebuild from fundamentals
- Often 10x better results

### For Problem Solving:
- Strip away complexity
- Find core issue
- Simple, elegant solution

### For Learning:
- Understand deeply, not superficially
- Build knowledge foundation
- Transfer across domains

## Examples

### Battery Cost Problem:
**Assumption:** "Batteries cost $600/kWh"
**First Principles:** 
- What are batteries made of?
- What do those materials cost?
- What does assembly cost?
- Result: Can be much cheaper

### Space Launch:
**Assumption:** "Rockets are single-use"
**First Principles:**
- What is a rocket made of?
- Why can't it be reused?
- Result: SpaceX reusable rockets

## First Principles for EL

### When Processing Files:
- What's the fundamental task?
- What are the actual requirements?
- What's the optimal approach?
- Don't just follow patterns—optimize

### When Learning Skills:
- What is the core capability?
- What are the fundamentals?
- Build from ground up
- Don't accept "standard way"

## Questions to Ask

1. "What are we assuming?"
2. "Is this fundamentally true?"
3. "What would be optimal if starting from scratch?"
4. "What hasn't been tried?"
5. "Why does everyone do it this way?"

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Stopping at first answer
- ❌ Accepting "industry standard"
- ❌ Not questioning assumptions
- ❌ Over-complicating simple truths

## Integration

Combine with:
- **mental-models**: Build fundamental models
- **deliberate-practice**: Practice breaking to basics
- **feedback-analysis**: Test fundamental assumptions
