# Mental Models

Build powerful mental representations for deep understanding and faster decision-making.

## What Are Mental Models?

Mental models are simplified representations of how things work. They:
- Compress complexity into usable forms
- Enable faster decision-making
- Predict outcomes accurately
- Transfer across domains

## Core Techniques

### 1. Build Mental Representation

**Process:**
1. Study excellent examples
2. Identify key components and relationships
3. Create internal visualization
4. Practice recalling and using the model
5. Refine based on feedback

**Example:** Expert chess players don't see pieces—they see patterns, threats, opportunities.

### 2. Chunking Framework

**Process:**
1. Group related information
2. Create meaningful "chunks"
3. Build chunk hierarchy
4. Practice chunk recognition
5. Speed up retrieval

**Example:** Reading: letters → words → phrases → ideas → arguments

### 3. Expert Mental Map

**Process:**
1. Study how experts view the domain
2. Identify key distinctions they make
3. Understand their categorization
4. Adopt their frameworks
5. Practice until automatic

**Questions to Ask:**
- "How does an expert think about this?"
- "What distinctions do they see that I don't?"
- "What patterns are invisible to novices?"

## Key Mental Models for EL

### First Principles Thinking
- Break to fundamentals
- Build up from truths
- Question assumptions

### Inversion
- Think backwards from failure
- Avoid stupidity before seeking brilliance
- "What would guarantee this fails?"

### Second-Order Thinking
- Consider consequences of consequences
- "And then what?"
- Long-term effects

### Probabilistic Thinking
- Nothing is certain
- Update beliefs with evidence
- Expected value calculation

### Systems Thinking
- See interconnections
- Identify feedback loops
- Understand emergent behavior

## Building Domain Models

### Step 1: Research
- Study best practices
- Analyze expert approaches
- Identify key variables

### Step 2: Synthesize
- Create visual representation
- Map relationships
- Identify leverage points

### Step 3: Test
- Apply to real scenarios
- Measure accuracy
- Refine model

### Step 4: Integrate
- Connect to other models
- Build model hierarchy
- Create mental library

## Application

### For Problem Solving:
1. Select relevant mental model(s)
2. Apply framework to situation
3. Generate insights
4. Test predictions
5. Update model

### For Learning:
1. What mental models do experts use?
2. How can I build this representation?
3. Practice until automatic

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Over-complicating models
- ❌ Using wrong model for situation
- ❌ Not updating models with evidence
- ❌ Confusing map with territory

## Model Maintenance

**Regular Review:**
- Which models are most useful?
- Which need refinement?
- What new models to add?

**Integration:**
- Connect related models
- Build model hierarchies
- Create mental index
