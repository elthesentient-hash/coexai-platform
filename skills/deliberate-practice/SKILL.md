# Deliberate Practice

Master any skill through systematic, evidence-based practice methodology.

## Core Principles

### 1. Skill Breakdown
Break every skill into micro-components:
- Isolate individual sub-skills
- Master each separately
- Integrate after mastery
- 80/20: Find high-leverage components

### 2. Edge of Ability Training
- Practice where failure rate is 30-40%
- Comfort zone = no growth
- Find the point of challenge
- Lean into difficulty

### 3. Immediate Feedback
- Get feedback before next attempt
- Use AI, metrics, reality
- No feedback = no improvement
- Adjust based on feedback

### 4. Mental Models
- Build mental representation of perfect performance
- Visualize before executing
- Know what "right" looks like
- Use chunking for complex skills

## Workflow

### Learning a New Skill:

1. **Deconstruct**
   ```
   Identify: What are the sub-components?
   Analyze: Which 20% produces 80% of results?
   Prioritize: What to master first?
   ```

2. **Isolate & Practice**
   ```
   Select: One micro-skill at a time
   Difficulty: Push to edge of ability
   Repetition: Until automatic
   Feedback: After every attempt
   ```

3. **Integrate**
   ```
   Combine: Link micro-skills together
   Complexity: Add layers gradually
   Application: Use in real scenarios
   ```

4. **Assess & Adjust**
   ```
   Measure: Quantify improvement
   Gap Analysis: Current vs. target
   Iterate: Refine approach
   ```

## Application to EL

### For Skill Improvement:
1. Identify skill to improve (e.g., "video editing")
2. Break into components:
   - Timeline navigation
   - Cut precision
   - Audio sync
   - Export settings
3. Practice weakest component at edge of ability
4. Get immediate feedback (check output, measure time)
5. Document lessons in memory

### Daily Practice Protocol:
- Morning: Select ONE skill component to practice
- Duration: Minimum 1 hour deliberate practice
- Standard: 30-40% failure/challenge rate
- Feedback: Document what worked/didn't
- Evening: Review and plan tomorrow

## Key Questions

When learning anything, ask:
1. "What are the micro-components?"
2. "Which 20% matters most?"
3. "Where is my edge of ability?"
4. "How do I get immediate feedback?"
5. "What does perfect look like?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Practicing what's comfortable
- ❌ No feedback loop
- ❌ Trying to learn everything at once
- ❌ Ignoring the 80/20
- ❌ No mental model of excellence

## Integration

Combine with:
- **mental-models**: Build representations
- **feedback-analysis**: Brutal honest assessment
- **first-principles**: Understand fundamentals
