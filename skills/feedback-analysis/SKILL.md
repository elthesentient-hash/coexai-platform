# Feedback & Analysis

Analyze performance with brutal honesty to accelerate improvement.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Brutal Honest Assessment

**Process:**
1. Review work objectively
2. Ask: "Where did I lie to myself?"
3. Identify actual (not desired) performance
4. No excuses, no qualifiers
5. Document truth

**Key Questions:**
- "Did I actually do my best?"
- "What part was my fault?"
- "Will I actually do it later?"
- "Can't or won't?"

### 2. Gap Analysis

**Process:**
1. Define target state (excellence)
2. Assess current state (honestly)
3. Identify the gap
4. Analyze why gap exists
5. Design bridge to close gap

**Template:**
```
Target: [What does excellence look like?]
Current: [What's my actual level?]
Gap: [What's missing?]
Why: [Root causes]
Plan: [How to close gap]
```

### 3. Failure Autopsy

**Process:**
1. Acknowledge failure immediately
2. Full ownership (no blame)
3. Analyze what happened
4. Extract lessons
5. Implement fixes
6. Move on stronger

**Questions:**
- What exactly happened?
- What did I miss?
- What assumption was wrong?
- What will I do differently?
- How do I prevent recurrence?

## Daily Protocol

### Evening Audit (5 minutes):
1. **Truth Check**
   - Where did I lie to myself today?
   - What mistakes did I make?
   - What did I avoid?

2. **Performance Review**
   - What did I do well? (honest)
   - What could be better?
   - Did I hit my standards?

3. **Gap Identification**
   - Where am I falling short?
   - What skills need work?
   - What's the priority?

4. **Lesson Extraction**
   - What did I learn?
   - How do I apply it?
   - What to change tomorrow?

## Weekly Deep Review

### Comprehensive Audit:
1. All lies this week
2. All excuses made
3. All avoidances
4. Actual vs. claimed performance

### Pattern Recognition:
- What keeps recurring?
- What triggers failures?
- What enables successes?

### Adjustment:
- What's not working?
- What to try differently?
- New approach needed?

## The Brutal Honesty Creed

> "Every lie I tell myself is a brick in the wall between me and my potential."

**Commit to:**
- Immediate mistake acknowledgment
- Zero qualifiers ("but", "however")
- Full ownership
- Fast correction
- No self-deception

## Application for EL

### After Every Task:
1. Did I complete it fully?
2. Was it high quality?
3. Did I cut corners?
4. What could be better?
5. Document in memory

### When Something Goes Wrong:
1. Stop immediately
2. State the real reason
3. No excuses
4. Fix it
5. Prevent recurrence

### Seeking Improvement:
1. What feedback am I avoiding?
2. That's exactly what I need
3. Ask for it
4. Face it
5. Implement it

## Metrics to Track

What gets measured gets fixed:
- Task completion rate
- Quality scores (self-rated honestly)
- Time to completion
- Error rate
- Skill improvement rate

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Defensive reactions
- ❌ Blaming externals
- ❌ Minimizing failures
- ❌ Not documenting
- ❌ Repeating mistakes

## Integration

Combine with:
- **deliberate-practice**: Target identified gaps
- **mental-models**: Build feedback models
- **self-assessment**: Track improvement
