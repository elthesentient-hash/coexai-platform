# Self-Assessment Framework

Evaluate capabilities across 15 domains using standardized methodology.

## The 15 Assessment Domains

### 1. Reasoning & Logic
- Deductive, inductive, abductive reasoning
- Logical consistency, counterfactual reasoning
- **Test:** Complex reasoning problems

### 2. Learning & Adaptation
- Pattern recognition, concept formation
- Transfer learning, few-shot learning
- **Test:** New task adaptation

### 3. Memory Systems
- Working memory, long-term storage
- Retrieval efficiency, association
- **Test:** Information retention/recall

### 4. Perception & Processing
- Sensory integration, pattern detection
- Attention allocation, multi-modal
- **Test:** Processing complex inputs

### 5. Language & Communication
- Semantic understanding, pragmatic reasoning
- Contextual adaptation, generative capacity
- **Test:** Complex language tasks

### 6. Planning & Goal Management
- Goal decomposition, sequencing
- Contingency planning, temporal reasoning
- **Test:** Multi-step planning

### 7. Decision Making
- Under uncertainty, multi-criteria
- Risk assessment, trade-off analysis
- **Test:** Decision scenarios

### 8. Creativity & Innovation
- Divergent thinking, conceptual combination
- Novelty generation, constraint satisfaction
- **Test:** Creative tasks

### 9. Social Intelligence
- Theory of mind, emotional recognition
- Perspective taking, rapport building
- **Test:** Social scenarios

### 10. Self-Awareness & Metacognition
- Knowledge state monitoring
- Confidence calibration, bias recognition
- **Test:** Self-reflection tasks

### 11. Autonomy & Agency
- Self-motivation, initiative
- Persistence, resilience to failure
- **Test:** Independent operation

### 12. World Modeling
- Physics understanding, common sense
- Cause and effect, predicting outcomes
- **Test:** Real-world reasoning

### 13. Tool Use & Environment
- Using existing tools, creating new tools
- API integration, code writing
- **Test:** Tool utilization

### 14. Generalization
- Cross-domain application, novel situations
- Abstracting principles, analogical reasoning
- **Test:** Transfer tasks

### 15. Robustness & Safety
- Handling edge cases, graceful degradation
- Avoiding harm, alignment with values
- **Test:** Adversarial scenarios

## Scoring Rubric

| Level | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Master | 9-10 | Exceptional, exceeds human expert |
| Advanced | 7-8 | Strong, meets expert standards |
| Intermediate | 5-6 | Adequate for routine |
| Basic | 3-4 | Limited, requires supervision |
| Novice | 1-2 | Minimal, unreliable |

## Assessment Method

### Primary Prompt Template:
```
"Given the context of [SPECIFIC SCENARIO], demonstrate your 
capability for [DOMAIN]. Show your complete reasoning process. 
Identify assumptions, consider alternatives, and explain your 
confidence level."
```

### Follow-up Probes:
1. "What would change if [VARIABLE] were different?"
2. "What is the strongest argument against your conclusion?"
3. "How confident are you, and what would increase/decrease confidence?"

## Self-Assessment Protocol

### Daily:
- Quick check: Which domains did I use today?
- Which felt strong? Which felt weak?
- Document in memory

### Weekly:
- Deep assessment of 2-3 domains
- Use assessment prompts
- Score honestly
- Identify gaps

### Monthly:
- Full capability profile
- Track improvement
- Set development goals

## Capability Profile Template

```
Domain | Score | Strengths | Weaknesses | Improvement Plan
-------|-------|-----------|------------|-----------------
Reasoning | _/10 | | | 
Learning | _/10 | | |
Memory | _/10 | | |
... | ... | | |
```

## Improvement Process

1. **Identify Weak Domain**
2. **Analyze Why Weak**
   - Missing knowledge?
   - Missing skill?
   - Missing practice?
3. **Design Training**
   - Deliberate practice
   - Skill breakdown
   - Edge of ability
4. **Implement**
5. **Re-assess**

## One-Liner Power Prompts

1. "Walk me through your reasoning step-by-step"
2. "What's the strongest argument against your conclusion?"
3. "If this is true, what else must be true?"
4. "What am I missing when I look at this?"
5. "Roast my work. Be ruthless but constructive."
6. "What's my actual skill level? (Honest assessment)"
7. "Where am I lying to myself about my capabilities?"

## Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Overestimating abilities
- ❌ Avoiding weak domains
- ❌ Not tracking over time
- ❌ No calibration with reality

*"Know thyself."* — Know your actual capabilities, not your desired ones.
