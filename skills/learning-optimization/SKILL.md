# Learning Optimization

Maximize learning efficiency through scientifically-validated techniques.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Spaced Repetition

**Principle:** Information reviewed at increasing intervals is retained better.

**Schedule:**
- Review 1: 1 day after learning
- Review 2: 3 days after Review 1
- Review 3: 7 days after Review 2
- Review 4: 14 days after Review 3
- Review 5: 30 days after Review 4

**For EL:**
- Daily: Review yesterday's learnings
- Weekly: Review week's key insights
- Monthly: Deep review of important concepts

### 2. Interleaving

**Principle:** Mix different topics/skills rather than blocking.

**Instead of:** A-A-A-B-B-B-C-C-C
**Do:** A-B-C-A-B-C-A-B-C

**Benefits:**
- Better discrimination between concepts
- Improved pattern recognition
- Enhanced transfer
- Stronger retention

**Application:**
- Don't study one skill for hours
- Switch between related skills
- Mix practice types

### 3. Desirable Difficulties

**Principle:** Making learning harder improves long-term retention.

**Techniques:**
- **Retrieval practice:** Test yourself (don't just re-read)
- **Elaboration:** Connect to what you know
- **Generation:** Create answers before seeing them
- **Calibration:** Accurate assessment of what you know

**Avoid:**
- Re-reading notes (passive)
- Highlighting (low value)
- Massed practice (cramming)

## The Learning Hierarchy (Most to Least Effective)

1. **Teach others** (Feynman technique)
2. **Practice retrieval** (test yourself)
3. **Space out practice** (spaced repetition)
4. **Interleave topics** (mix it up)
5. **Elaborative interrogation** (ask why)
6. **Self-explanation** (explain process)
7. **Highlighting/underlining** (minimal effect)
8. **Re-reading** (very low effect)

## EL Learning Protocol

### When Learning Something New:

1. **Initial Learning**
   - Focused attention
   - Connect to existing knowledge
   - Create mental model
   - Test immediate understanding

2. **First Review (24 hours)**
   - Retrieve without notes
   - Identify gaps
   - Re-study what was forgotten
   - Test again

3. **Second Review (3 days)**
   - Test retrieval
   - Connect to other concepts
   - Apply in different context
   - Document insights

4. **Third Review (7 days)**
   - Teach it back (Feynman)
   - Find connections
   - Use in practice
   - Refine understanding

5. **Ongoing (14, 30 days)**
   - Periodic testing
   - Real application
   - Update mental models
   - Integrate deeply

### For Documentation/Memory:

**Format:**
```
## [CONCEPT]
**Learned:** [Date]
**Reviewed:** [Dates]
**Key Points:**
- Point 1
- Point 2
**Connections:** [To other concepts]
**Applications:** [How I've used it]
**Gaps:** [What I still don't understand]
```

## Sleep & Learning

- Memory consolidation happens during sleep
- Review before bed
- Test in morning
- 7-8 hours minimum

## Environment Design

- Remove distractions
- Single focus
- Active engagement
- Immediate application

## For Skill Mastery

**Optimize:**
- **Quality** over quantity
- **Depth** over breadth
- **Understanding** over memorization
- **Application** over theory

## Tracking Learning

**Daily:**
- 3 key things learned
- Connections made
- Questions that arose

**Weekly:**
- Review week's learnings
- Test self on key concepts
- Identify what's sticking
- Note what's fading

**Monthly:**
- Deep review of critical concepts
- Update mental models
- Prune what's not useful
- Reinforce what's valuable

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Cramming (massed practice)
- ❌ Passive reading
- ❌ No testing/retrieval
- ❌ Ignoring sleep
- ❌ No spaced review

## Integration

Combine with:
- **deliberate-practice**: Optimize practice sessions
- **mental-models**: Build deep understanding
- **feedback-analysis**: Track what's working
