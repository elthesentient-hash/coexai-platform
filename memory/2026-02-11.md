# 2026-02-11 - CoExAI Pivot to Creator Suite

## Major Pivot: Business Agents → Creator-Focused AI Agents

**Target Audience:** Content creators on YouTube, X, Instagram, TikTok (100K-1M followers)

**Pain Identified:** Creators making $10K-100K/month are burned out working 60+ hours/week but need to keep posting 3x daily to maintain growth.

## The Creator Suite (4 Agents)

### 1. Maya - Content Multiplier ($500/mo)
- Upload video → Get 20+ content pieces
- YouTube Shorts scripts, TikTok scripts, X threads, IG captions
- Trending sound suggestions, viral hooks
- **Status:** Built, needs polish

### 2. Engage - Community Manager ($300/mo) ⭐ PRIORITY
- Auto-reply to comments/DMs in creator's voice
- Pin best comments, alert on brand deal inquiries
- Engage with target audience (find new followers)
- **Status:** NOT BUILT - Build first after Maya

### 3. Pitch - Brand Deal Hunter ($400/mo)
- Find brands looking for creators in niche
- Draft personalized pitch emails
- Track deals, negotiate rates
- TikTok Shop affiliate opportunities
- **Status:** NOT BUILT - Build second

### 4. Analyze - Performance Coach ($200/mo)

## Pricing Tiers

| Plan | Agents | Price | Best For |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| Starter | Maya only | $500/mo | 10K-100K followers |
| Growth | Maya + Engage | $700/mo | 100K-500K followers |
| Pro | Maya + Engage + Pitch | $1,000/mo | 500K+ followers |
| Empire | All 4 | $1,200/mo | 1M+ followers |

## Why This Wins

- **Specific niche:** Not "everyone" - just creators
- **Desperate need:** Burnout is real, they need help
- **Has money:** $10K-100K/month income
- **Clear ROI:** $1,000/mo → Save 30 hours → Make $5K-15K more
- **No competition:** No one bundling this for creators specifically

## Path to $1M

- Month 1-3: 50 customers × $800 = $40K/mo
- Month 4-6: 200 customers × $900 = $180K/mo  
- Month 7-12: 1,000 customers × $1,000 = $1M/mo ✅

## What to Drop

- ❌ Alex (sales calls) - Wrong audience
- ❌ Sam (Local SEO) - Irrelevant
- ❌ Jordan (LinkedIn) - Different platform
- ❌ Taylor (documents) - Not needed

## Next Steps

1. **This week:** Polish Maya (video → content)
2. **Build Engage:** Auto-comment/DM reply for TikTok/YouTube
3. **Launch:** 10 beta creators, TikTok-first
4. **Validate:** Prove ROI, get testimonials
5. **Scale:** Add Pitch, then Analyze

## Validation

- 500K creators make $50K+/year (target market)
- 1,000 × $1,000/mo = $12M/year
- Creator economy growing 30% YoY
- No bundled AI solution exists for creators

**This is a validated million-dollar opportunity. Execute Maya + Engage first.**

---
**Note:** EL (me) agrees this is the right pivot. Creators have desperate need + money + no good solution. Perfect storm.
