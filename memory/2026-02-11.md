## Video Transcription Success
- Successfully downloaded and transcribed X/Twitter video
- Updated yt-dlp to latest version (2026.02.04) to bypass X/Twitter blocking
- Video content: Music clip with repetitive lyrics "If I could let it go" / "Rap, rap"
- Tools used: yt-dlp + Whisper (tiny model)

## Phone Agent Status
- **PAUSED** per user request ("well do the voice later")
- New repo created: `elthesentient-hash/el-phone-agent-v2`
- Railway deployment needs debugging (crashed)
- Will resume when user is ready

## Key Technical Win
- Figured out X/Twitter video download by updating yt-dlp in virtual environment
- System package was outdated (2024.04.09), updated to 2026.02.04

## User Preferences
- Voice setup postponed
- Can transcribe videos on demand
