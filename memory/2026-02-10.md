## Lessons Learned

**From Elijah:** "Consistently persevere no matter what"
- YouTube bot detection blocked us → Found `--force-ipv4` workaround
- Audio was missing from clips → Re-cut all 5 with sound
- Multiple obstacles → Kept trying until solved
- **Takeaway:** Don't give up when facing technical hurdles. Try different approaches, ask clarifying questions, and keep iterating until it works.
