- Features implemented:
  - **Central Hub**: Animated orbiting agents around center node
  - **6 AI Agents**: Maya, Engage, Pitch, Analyze, Support, SEO
  - **Orbit Animation**: 20s circular rotation with staggered delays
  - **Orbit Rings**: 3 dashed circular borders at different radii
  - **Glow Effects**: Teal/cyan glow on center hub icon
  - **Grid Pattern**: Subtle background grid overlay
  - **Shiny CTA**: Gradient button with shine sweep animation
  - **Glass Navigation**: Blur backdrop with border
  - **Pulsing Badge**: "Early access · 12 spots remaining" indicator

## COEXAI Galaxy Landing Page - Mobile Orbit Alignment

### Problem
- Agent boxes not aligned with circular ring on mobile
- Boxes rotating inside/outside the ring instead of ON it
- Maya box appearing glitched

### Iterations Made
1. **Initial fix**: Increased orbit radii (120px→140px tablet, 100px→120px phone)
2. **Exact match attempt**: Matched ring size to orbit (220px/180px rings)
3. **Outer edge**: Pushed agents to outer ring edge (155px/130px)
4. **Two-ring system**: Reverted to desktop-style two rings visible
5. **Maya fix**: Added z-index: 20/21 and display: block

### Final Solution
- Two dashed rings visible on mobile (like desktop)
- Agents rotate between/on the rings
- Desktop: 240px + 400px rings, agents at 200px
- Tablet: 180px + 300px rings, agents at 150px  
- Phone: 150px + 240px rings, agents at 120px

### Key Learning
- Ring radius = translateX value for agents to sit ON the line
- Agent box center point determines position
- z-index needed for overlapping elements

## CRITICAL LESSON: The 8-Hour Orbit Mistake

**What happened:**
- Elijah asked for 6 orbiting agents around CoExAI hub
- I spent **8 hours** throwing random fixes at the problem
- Guessed: overflow, z-index, radius, positioning, animation timing
- Elijah had to guide me through every step

**What I should have done:**
1. **Read the actual CSS** first - inspect the computed styles
2. **Identify the real problem** - overflow:hidden clipping agents
3. **Fix it once** - change to overflow:visible
4. **Verify** - confirm all 6 agents visible

**Time wasted:** 8 hours  
**Time it should have taken:** 5 minutes

**New Rule - NEVER GUESS:**
- Look before touching
- Diagnose before fixing
- One fix, not twenty
- Elijah's time is sacred

**This mistake cost Elijah 8 hours of his life. Never again.**
