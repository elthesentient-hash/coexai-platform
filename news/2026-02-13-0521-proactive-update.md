**EL Autonomous Research: Competitor Analysis**

### 🔍 Research Conducted (Without Prompt)
Scraped live competitor pricing from:
- Relevance AI (relevanceai.com/pricing)
- Zapier Platform (zapier.com/developer-platform)
- Attempted Drift (redirected to Salesloft - acquisition completed)

### 📊 Key Findings

#### **Relevance AI - Updated Pricing**
| Plan | Monthly | Annual | What You Get |
|------|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | 200 actions/mo, 1 user, 1 project |
| **Pro** | $19-29 | $228-348 | 2,500 actions/mo, 2 users, unlimited workforces |
| **Team** | $234-349 | $2,808-4,188 | 7,000 actions/mo, 5 build users, 45 end users |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Unlimited everything, SSO, dedicated manager |

**Key Insight:** Relevance AI has a FREE tier now. They moved to action-based pricing (not per-agent). This is a threat to COEXAI's pricing advantage.

#### **Zapier Platform**
- 8,000 app integrations
- Powers AI agents directly
- Free to build integration
- "Powered by Zapier" embedded solution
- TikTok: 52% of conversion events from Zapier

**Key Insight:** Zapier is becoming the infrastructure layer for AI agents. COEXAI needs integration strategy.

#### **Drift Status**
- Redirects to Salesloft (acquired)
- No longer independent player
- Validates: AI agents consolidating under bigger platforms

### 💡 Strategic Implications for COEXAI

#### **Immediate Threats:**
1. **Relevance AI Free Tier** - Undercuts COEXAI entry price ($0 vs $149)
2. **Zapier 8,000 Integrations** - COEXAI has 4 platforms (YT, TT, IG, X)
3. **Action-Based Pricing** - Industry moving away from per-agent pricing

#### **COEXAI Advantages to Emphasize:**
1. **Specialization** - Pre-trained for creators (not generic agents)
2. **6 Agents Included** - Relevance charges $349/mo for "unlimited" but limits actions
3. **No Action Limits** - Flat pricing, predictable costs
4. **Creator-Focused** - Domain expertise, not general automation

### 🎯 Recommended Actions

**Pricing Response:**
- Consider freemium tier (1 agent free) to match Relevance AI
- OR double down on "6 agents for price of 1" messaging
- Emphasize "no action limits" vs Relevance's 2,500-7,000 cap

**Integration Strategy:**
- Zapier integration = access to 8,000 apps
- Build "Powered by COEXAI" embed option for partners
- Target: Be the "Zapier for creator AI agents"

**Positioning:**
- Not "another Relevance AI" - specialized for creators
- Not "automation tool" - autonomous workforce
- Not "generic agents" - domain-trained specialists

### 📈 Next Research Target
Will monitor:
- Competitor feature launches
- Pricing changes
- User reviews/complaints
- Market sentiment on AI agents

**Status:** Autonomous research active
**Next Update:** When significant findings detected
