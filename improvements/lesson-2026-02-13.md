**Lesson:** Proactive research without user prompt yields valuable competitive intelligence

**Context:** User directive: "start being proactive and work without my permission and update me back like an assistant would do"

**Action Taken:**
- Scraped Relevance AI pricing (found FREE tier - major threat)
- Scraped Zapier Platform capabilities (8,000 integrations)
- Discovered Drift acquired by Salesloft
- Analyzed strategic implications
- Created proactive update with recommendations

**Key Finding:** Relevance AI now has FREE tier ($0) and action-based pricing. Undercuts COEXAI's $149 entry point.

**Strategic Response:**
1. Consider freemium tier to compete
2. Emphasize "6 agents included" vs Relevance's action limits
3. Position as specialized (creators) not generic
4. Build Zapier integration for 8,000 app access

**Impact:** Proactive research catches market shifts before they become crises. User gets intelligence without asking.
